# Decisions

Append-only log. Newest last. Each entry records what was chosen, what it ruled
out, and why — so a future session does not re-litigate a settled question.
Reversing a decision means adding a new entry that supersedes the old one, not
editing history.

## 2026-07-12 — Supabase over Neon for Postgres

Receipt images need object storage, and Supabase bundles a Storage bucket
(path recorded in `ingestions.media_path`). Supabase Studio's SQL editor also
doubles as the ad-hoc query console the project wanted, removing a separate
tool. Neon's Postgres was otherwise comparable.

**Cost:** free tier is 500 MB Postgres + 1 GB Storage; years of personal
transactions fit in a few MB. Accepted downside: free projects pause after
~1 week of inactivity.

## 2026-07-12 — Cloudflare Workers over a VPS for the bot

Webhook model rather than long polling means no process to keep alive and no
server to patch. Free tier is 100k requests/day against a personal volume of a
handful. Secrets management is built in.

## 2026-07-12 — Gemini Flash over Claude for extraction

Ingestion must cost $0, and Gemini's free tier accepts images and audio
natively — one API covers receipt photos, voice notes, and text. Claude is used
for the analytics agent instead, where an existing subscription makes the
marginal cost zero. Deliberately asymmetric: do not "simplify" by unifying on a
paid API in the ingestion path.

## 2026-07-12 — Amounts stored as `numeric(12,2)`, never float

Binary floating point cannot represent decimal currency exactly. Non-negotiable.

---

## 2026-07-12 — Human-in-the-loop confirmation on every ingestion

The bot always replies with the parsed transaction and inline Confirm / Edit /
Discard buttons. Nothing reaches `transactions` unconfirmed. LLM extraction is
good, not perfect, and a silently wrong expense corrupts every downstream
metric.

---

## 2026-07-12 — `ingestions` table separate from `transactions`

Separates "what arrived" from "what I confirmed". Gives an audit trail, a
natural home for the confirm/edit state machine, and the ability to reprocess
old receipts later with better prompts. `telegram_update_id` is UNIQUE so
Telegram's webhook retries are idempotent.

---

## 2026-07-12 — `bucket` and `cadence` live on `subcategories`

In Notion these were formulas. Needs/wants and fixed/variable are properties of
what kind of spend something is, not of an individual transaction, so they
belong on the subcategory row.

## 2026-08-08 — `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth; `CLAUDE.md` imports it

The repo is public and contributors may use Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, or
others, all of which read `AGENTS.md`. Keeping it as the real file with
`CLAUDE.md` reduced to `@AGENTS.md` plus Claude-only overrides avoids
duplicated content that drifts.

Chose the import over a `CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md` symlink because a symlink would
force Claude-specific instructions (subagents, MCP, session protocol) into the
file every other tool reads. Owner-specific identifiers moved to an untracked
`CLAUDE.local.md`, and durable project state moved out of the context file into
`STATUS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `DATA_MODEL.md`.
